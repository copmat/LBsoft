The 'execute' Sub-directory

In the supplied version of LBsoft, this sub-directory is intended to
be the `working' directory from which jobs are submitted for execution
and the data files manipulated. 

Executing the Program

To run LBsoft, it is necessary first to ensure that the program is
compiled (from the source sub-directory) and that the file input.dat
is present in the execute subdirectory. 
Note that a Message Passing Interface Implementation is necessary 
to compile and run LBsoft in parallel mode.
All output data files will be returned to the execute sub-directory.
Remember that the input file HAS TO BE NAMED 'input.dat' and put in
the 'execute' Sub-directory.

Example command to run LBsoft in serial mode:

./main.x

Example command to run LBsoft in parallel mode on 4 CPUs:

mpirun -np 4 ./main.x
